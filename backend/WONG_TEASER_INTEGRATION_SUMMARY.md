# Wong Teaser Integration Summary

## What I Built

I've created a comprehensive Wong teaser analysis system that integrates seamlessly with your existing Unified Betting infrastructure. The system analyzes NFL games for optimal teaser opportunities based on Stanford Wong's strategy and ranks them by multiple criteria.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Core Analysis Engine (`wong_teaser_analyzer.py`)
- **WongTeaserAnalyzer**: Main analysis class with all Wong criteria logic
- **Strict & Expanded Rules**: Both original Wong rules and expanded ranges
- **Multiple Teaser Types**: 2-team 6pt, 3-team 6pt, 4-team 6pt, 3-team 10pt (sweetheart)
- **EV Calculations**: Expected value and ROI calculations for different odds
- **Criteria-Based Ranking**: Ranks bets by how many optimal criteria they meet

### 2. Data Integration (`wong_data_integration.py`)
- **WongDataIntegration**: Integrates with your existing Pinnacle/BetBCK data
- **GameData Conversion**: Converts your existing data formats to Wong analysis format
- **Schedule Enhancement**: Adds week, divisional, and primetime information

### 3. BetBCK Scraper (`wong_teaser_scraper.py`)
- **WongTeaserBetBCKScraper**: Scrapes NFL odds specifically for Wong analysis
- **Uses Your Existing Payload**: Same URL and payload structure as your current system
- **NFL-Only Focus**: Only scrapes NFL games as requested
- **Your Book's Odds**: Pre-configured with your specific odds (-110, +160, +300, -120)

### 4. API Integration (`main.py`)
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/wong-teaser/analyze` - One-click analysis
- **No Breaking Changes**: Added to existing main.py without modifying other functionality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. Frontend Component (`WongTeaserAnalyzer.tsx`)
- **Modern UI**: Matches your existing dark theme and styling
- **One-Click Analysis**: Single button to analyze all NFL games
- **Comprehensive Display**: Shows games, recommendations, criteria scores, ROI
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Positioned Correctly**: Between POD Alerts and EV Calculator as requested

## Wong Teaser Rules Implemented

### Strict Wong Rules (Highest Win Rates)
- **Underdogs**: +1.5 to +2.5 (tease to +7.5 to +8.5)
- **Favorites**: -7.5 to -8.5 (tease to -1.5 to -2.5)
- **Historical Win Rate**: ~75-78%

### Expanded Wong Rules (More Games)
- **Underdogs**: +1.5 to +3.0 (tease to +7.5 to +9.0)
- **Favorites**: -7.5 to -9.0 (tease to -1.5 to -3.0)
- **Historical Win Rate**: ~73-75%

### Sweetheart 10-Point Rules
- **Underdogs**: +1.5 to +2.5 (tease to +11.5 to +12.5)
- **Favorites**: -10.0 to -10.5 (tease to PK to -0.5)
- **Historical Win Rate**: ~85-90%

### Optimal Filters (Higher Win Rates)
- Home underdogs (+1.5 to +2.5)
- Road favorites (-7.5 to -8.5)
- Game totals under 44
- Non-divisional games
- Weeks 3-14 (avoid Week 1 and late season)
- Avoid primetime games

## Your Book's Odds Configuration

The system is pre-configured with your specific odds:

- **2-Team 6pt**: -110 (Risk 110 to Win 100) → ~8.6% ROI
- **3-Team 6pt**: +160 (Risk 100 to Win 160) → ~11.5% ROI
- **4-Team 6pt**: +300 (Risk 100 to Win 300) → ~29.6% ROI
- **3-Team 10pt**: -120 (Risk 120 to Win 100) → ~16.6% ROI

## How It Works

1. **One-Click Analysis**: User clicks "Analyze NFL Teasers" button
2. **BetBCK Scraping**: System scrapes NFL odds using your existing payload structure
3. **Wong Criteria Check**: Analyzes each game for Wong teaser qualifications
4. **EV Calculation**: Calculates expected value and ROI for each teaser type
5. **Criteria Ranking**: Ranks recommendations by how many optimal criteria they meet
6. **Results Display**: Shows games, recommendations, and detailed analysis

## Integration Points
