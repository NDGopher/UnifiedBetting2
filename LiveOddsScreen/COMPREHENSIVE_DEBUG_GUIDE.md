## 🔍 **EXTENSIVE DEBUG FEATURES ADDED**

### **1. Dynamic Sports Selection**
```
🔍 [PLive-Debug] === SELECTION ANALYSIS ===
🔍 [PLive-Debug] Raw selections received: ['epl:moneyline', 'la_liga:spread']
🔍 [PLive-Debug] Processing selection: 'epl:moneyline'
🔍 [PLive-Debug]   → Extracted sport: 'epl', market: 'moneyline'
🔍 [PLive-Debug] Unique sports extracted: ['epl', 'la_liga']
🔍 [PLive-Debug] Looking up PLive path for sport: 'epl'
🔍 [PLive-Debug]   ✅ Mapped 'epl' → '#!/sport/220'
🔍 [PLive-Debug] Final PLive paths to scrape: ['#!/sport/220']
```

### **2. PTO Connection Diagnostics**
```
🎯 [PTO] === PTO DRIVER INITIALIZATION ===
🎯 [PTO] Raw debug_port from config: 9223
🎯 [PTO] Parsed debug_port: 9223
🎯 [PTO] Driver params: user_data_dir=C:\Users\steph\AppData\Local\PTO_Chrome_Profile
🎯 [PTO] ✅ PTO driver created successfully!
🎯 [PTO] Driver session ID: abc123...
```

### **3. PLive Scraping Details**
```
🔥 [PLive] === PLIVE SCRAPING CYCLE ===
🔥 [PLive] Processing path: #!/sport/220
🔥 [PLive] ✅ Created driver for #!/sport/220
🔥 [PLive] ✅ Sport_220 events scraped: 15
🔥 [PLive] Sample events from Sport_220:
🔥 [PLive]   Event 1: SOCCER - Arsenal vs Chelsea (moneyline)
```

### **4. Data Matching Analysis**
```
📊 [Merge] === DATA MATCHING ===
📊 [Merge] PLive events: 15
📊 [Merge] PTO events: 12
📊 [Merge] Sample PLive events:
📊 [Merge]   PLive 1: SOCCER - Arsenal vs Chelsea (moneyline)
📊 [Merge] Sample PTO events:
📊 [Merge]   PTO 1: EPL - Arsenal vs Chelsea (moneyline)
📊 [Merge] Successful matches: 8
```

## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING WITH DEBUG OUTPUT**

### **Issue: No PLive Data**
Look for:
```
🔥 [PLive] ❌ Selection file does not exist!
🔥 [PLive] ❌ No PLive mapping found for sport: 'xyz'
🔥 [PLive] ❌ Failed to create driver for #!/sport/X
```

**Solutions:**
- Check if you made selections in the GUI
- Verify sport is in the mapping (see debug output)
- Check for driver creation errors

### **Issue: No PTO Data**
Look for:
```
🎯 [PTO] ❌ Failed to create PTO driver: connection refused
🎯 [PTO] ❌ PTO scraping skipped - use_pto_dom:False
🎯 [PTO] ❌ No PTO driver available
```

**Solutions:**
1. Start Chrome with debugging: `python start_pto_chrome.py`
2. Check Chrome profile exists
3. Verify debug port 9223 is available

### **Issue: No Matches**
Look for:
```
📊 [Merge] PLive events: 15
📊 [Merge] PTO events: 0
📊 [Merge] Successful matches: 0
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure both PLive and PTO have data
- Check team name matching in sample events
- Verify sport/market alignment
