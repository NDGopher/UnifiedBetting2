# LiveOddsScreen - Quick Startup Guide

## üéØ **SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY WORKING!**

The encoding issues are fixed and your system is operational. Here's the correct startup sequence:

---

## üöÄ **STEP-BY-STEP STARTUP**

### **Step 1: Start PTO Chrome with Debugging** 
```bash
python start_pto_chrome.py
```

**What this does:**
- Kills any existing Chrome processes
- Starts Chrome with your PTO profile
- Enables debug port 9223
- Opens PTO odds screen
- Keeps Chrome running for the live screen to connect to

**Expected output:**
```
üöÄ Starting PTO Chrome with Debug
==================================================
‚úÖ Found Chrome at: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
üî™ Killing all Chrome processes...
‚úÖ Killed X Chrome processes
üåê Launching Chrome: [command details]
‚è≥ Waiting for Chrome debug port 9223 to be ready...
‚úÖ Chrome debug port 9223 is ready!
‚úÖ Chrome is ready for PTO integration!
```

**IMPORTANT:** Leave this Chrome window open! Don't close it.

### **Step 2: Launch LiveOddsScreen**
```bash
start_live_screen.bat
```

**What this does:**
- Runs system diagnostics
- Checks all configurations
- Launches the sports selector GUI
- Starts the live odds dashboard

### **Step 3: Select Your Sports**
In the GUI that opens:
- Choose whatever sports you want (MLB, WNBA, EPL, etc.)
- Select markets (moneyline, spread, total)
- Click "Start"

### **Step 4: Access Dashboard**
Open your browser to: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html`

## üìä **WHAT YOU'LL SEE**

### **Console Output (Good Signs):**
```
[Init] Starting dashboard on port 8765...
[Config] Loading configuration files...
[Browser] Profile exists: True
[PTO] Selected PTO tabs: 6
[PTO] Opening PTO driver (headless=True, debug_port=9223)...

[PLive] SUCCESS: Sport_1 events scraped: 15
[Merge] PLive events: 15
[Merge] PTO events: 12
[Merge] Successful matches: 8
```

### **Dashboard:**
- Live updating table with odds
- Multiple sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, etc.)
- Best odds highlighted
- Real-time updates

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Can't reach this page" Error:**
1. Make sure the dashboard URL is exactly: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html`
2. Check console for "Dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html"
3. Try refreshing the page after 10 seconds

### **No PTO Data:**
```
[PTO] ERROR: Failed to create PTO driver: connection refused
```
**Solution:** Make sure you started PTO Chrome first with `python start_pto_chrome.py`

### **No PLive Data:**
```
[PLive] ERROR: Failed to create driver for #!/sport/X
```
**Solution:** This is usually network/firewall related. PLive drivers should work headless.

### **No Matches:**
```
[Merge] Successful matches: 0
```
**Solution:** Check that both PLive and PTO have data for the same sports.
